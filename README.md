# Welcome to the Ibis and IbisML tutorial!

## Getting started

To follow along, create a GitHub Codespace on https://github.com/deepyaman/lichess-live-win-probability-tutorial:

1. Create a new codespace on `main`, making sure to choose "New with options..."

2. Create the codespace in US East (prebuild available) with at least 4 cores

3. Wait for the codespace to be fully initialized (you should see `(lichess-live-win-probability-tutorial)` at the start of your terminal prompt)

4. Run `git pull` in your terminal to ensure that you have the latest code

While it's possible to run everything on your local machine, we will not be able to debug issues outside Codespaces.
