    "# Motivation\n",
    "Tools such as pandas assume that you can fit all of your data in RAM on your local machine. But data often lives in data warehouses, so we end up trying to:\n",
    "* Download significant amounts of data onto our local machines and slurp it all up into memory\n",
    "* Experiment with it and develop a proof-of-concept in Python\n",
    "* When we need productionize it, rewrite the code in something more scalable\n",
    "\n",
    "Data warehouses are typically stored on something bigger and more powerful than my laptop, plus the data is already there. They also have SQL backends that are highly optimized/extremely fast. So ideally we'd want to:\n",
    "* Take a small sample of the data and load it using a local database such as DuckDB\n",
    "* Develop in Python, but have it leverage the performance of SQL engines under-the-hood\n",
    "* In production, use the same code to process large amounts data on the data warehouse where it already lives, avoiding a code rewrite\n",
    "* Get to keep all of your code, from data engineering to machine learning, in Python!\n",

    "Ibis enables this by providing a unified dataframe interface to 20+ backends. The syntax is similar to dplyr in R, or Polars in Python (and Polars is also one of the supported backends). "
